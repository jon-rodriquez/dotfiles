## My Configuration Files

This repository contains my configuration files for various programs. I use these files to quickly set up my development environment on a new machine.

### lf

its a terminal file manager

### lunarvim

its a neovim configuration based on LunarVim. Find out more here -> https://www.lunarvim.org
I have added some custom keybindings and plugins on top of the default configuration

### sketchybar

Its a status bar program that I use on the mac. I use the Mac's feature of workspaces and have a status bar that shows the current workspace and the current application in that workspace.
I have also add keybindings to switch between workspaces and applications.
In Mac you can use alt + <number> to switch between workspaces.

### tmux

Its a terminal multiplexer. I have added some custom keybindings and plugins on top of the default configuration that allows me to quickly switch between tmux panes and windows.
I have also added a plugin that allows me to navigate between tmux panes and neovim panes using the same keybindings.

### tmuxifier

Its a tmux session manager. I have added my own custom layouts and configurations to quickly set up my development environment.
There are very specific layouts that I use for different projects. Should only be used as a reference.

### zsh

Its a shell configuration. I have added some custom keybindings and plugins on top of the default configuration that allows me to quickly navigate between directories and files.
